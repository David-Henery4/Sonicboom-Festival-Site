"SonicBoom is a fictional music festival website based primarily around electronic music"

SonicBoom is a festival web site that takes inspiration from many other similar sites in both design and layout and tries to create vibrant experience for the visitor. The site is designed to be fully responsive and work on all screens from mobile to desktop. If you would like to check it out follow this link: https://sonicboom-festival.netlify.app/

## Design, colour theme & layout

SonicBoom takes inspiration from other music festival sites by using a **bright and vibrant colour theme**, which is used to try and showcase a summery feel for the festival.

The design shares many characteristics with other festival sites, for instance, having a **countdown timer** to show vistors when the festival opens. It also has components like **image galleries** and **image carousels** to really try and showcase the festival experience to the vistor.

The layout of the site is a **simplistic** one, which starts with a **header**, then a **about section**, a **sign-up section**, then a **image gallery** before leading into the other pages to show more details of the festival. It's designed to **showcase the festival experience** to the user before moving on to the festivals other details like line up, tickets, accomodation, travel etc.

## Technologies used

Technologies used to develop this site were:

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS/Sass
* Git
* Parcel

**Javascript** was used to implement the **fucntionality** of things like the **navigation**, The **carousels** (making them responsive), **countdown timer** and the **accordian** dropdown functionality.

**HTML** & **CSS/Sass** were used for the structure, styling and layout of the site. While **Git** was used for version control and **parcel** was used as the bundler to create the final package of the site.

## Areas to improve

There are a few areas were i feel like this site could be improved. 

The home page layout is solid but the sites other pages seem to be basic and if i were to start other, i would add other designs like adding background patterns, better use of the sites colour theme to try and make the pages stand out and be unique while maintaining the sites overall aesthetic. 

I would also implement subtle animations on some sections of the site to try to bring the site to life and make it a more visually pleasing experience for the visitor.
